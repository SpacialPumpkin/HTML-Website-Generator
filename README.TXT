Website Creator 1.0
Created by Evan Leider

To launch the program, make sure you have Java installed, then
please run the HTMLWebsiteGenerator.jar executable.

How to Use:
This program creates 3 connected HTML webpages with an accompanying stylesheet.css 
based on your custom input and design. Each page includes a universal colored navigation bar.
Use the color pickers and fields to customize your output website, and press Generate 
when you're done! Please don't leave page fields empty. You can add a custom URL from Google Web Fonts 
to add custom font to your generated HTML and CSS! To do this, pick a font on https://fonts.google.com/, 
select it and choose embed code. Copy the the url inside starting with https://fonts.googleapis.com/... 
and paste it into the app's font URL field.
